= Lab 5: Snake

If you haven't done so already, get the source code for snake.

----
# Go into your repository
cd ~/COMP201-2014
# Commit your work (if any) first
git commit -am "Work in progress"
# Get the code
git pull upstream master
----

In `labs/lab5` is the code for snake. Try to build and run the code.

----
# Go into lab 5 folder
cd labs/lab5
# Make snake (Windows)
gmake
# Make snake (Mac OS X, Linux)
make
# Run snake
./lab5.exe
----

The code has TODO items in it.

. You need to detect collisions with the head of the snake and:
.. *food*. This should grow the snake and randomly place the food somewhere else.
.. *the perimeter of the screen*. This should kill the snake.
.. the snake itself. This should kill the snake.
. Swap out `std::list` with your own implementation of a doubly-linked list in `list.cpp`.

Also, if you're up for a challenge, try to modify the view to render the snake
using the snake parts in `labs/lab5/assets/snake.png`.
